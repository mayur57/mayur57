## excerpt 1

For a long time, morality was a dirty word to me. It didn’t mean kindness, honesty, or fairness. It meant control. It meant being told how long your hair could be, what words you were allowed to say, who you could love, and which god you could believe in—if any. Morality wasn’t about helping people. It was about restricting them. And that’s where many people’s discomfort with the word begins.

But morality, like language, isn’t a static thing. It shifts. It mutates. It can be used as a weapon or as a balm. And as I’ve aged, my understanding of morality has become less reactive and more layered.

Let’s start with a simple distinction: taboos. When looking at another culture, taboos often seem like arbitrary rules. But in our own, they don’t feel like rules at all. They feel like reality. Take public nudity. Some nipples are legal, others illegal. Everyone knows which are allowed and which aren’t, even if the distinction makes no objective sense. That’s the power of a taboo. It's so entrenched that questioning it feels unnatural. It doesn’t just reflect social order. It defines it.

Many taboos, when examined closely, aren’t based on harm reduction. They're about control. They're about suppressing groups, enforcing hierarchies, and maintaining appearances. And when morality aligns with these kinds of taboos, it rightfully earns a bad reputation. It becomes a tool of conformity, not of justice.

There’s also the second kind of morality: the cultural glue kind. These are shared norms that aren’t especially harmful or virtuous but still serve a purpose. Think of curse words. They’re usually built around sex, bodies, or other topics that polite society is squeamish about. There’s no real harm in most curse words, but their power exists because of the taboo. Without that tension, a curse word is just another word.

I like these norms. They’re weird, a little arbitrary, and in a way, comforting. They give us shared signals. They help us identify when someone is joking, when someone is angry, when someone is deliberately pushing a boundary. As long as they’re not used to exclude or control people, these little oddities of culture can bind us together.

But there’s a third kind of morality, and this is the kind worth preserving, nurturing, and enforcing. This is the morality rooted in harm reduction, care, and social integrity. These are the norms that protect people from being dehumanized, manipulated, or exploited. Slurs are a prime example. They're taboo not because they're shocking or impolite but because they’re weapons of hate. They carry the weight of history, violence, and systemic harm. They devalue people. That’s why we reject them.

This same logic applies to lying, cheating, scamming, and abuse. These aren’t just socially awkward behaviors. They're corrosive. They degrade trust, destroy relationships, and fray the fabric of society. When someone cheats on a test, they sabotage fairness. When someone commits tax fraud, they rob from the collective. When someone lies pathologically, they make honesty harder for everyone else.

Some norms used to be clearer. Gambling, for instance, once had a stronger taboo around it. Not because people didn't enjoy it, but because we understood its harm. Gambling addiction destroys lives. It manipulates. It encourages platforms to reward exploitation. The normalization of mobile gambling apps over the past few years is unsettling not because they’re new, but because we've lost our instinct to question them. It's become just another business model, and that reveals something broken.

There’s also a worrying trend where scamming is being rebranded as cleverness in some circles. As if manipulating someone for gain is a sign of intelligence or hustle. But a society that celebrates antisocial behavior because it produces wealth is a society eating itself. We shouldn’t have to explain why scamming is immoral. It just is.

And maybe that’s part of the goal here. Real morality, the third kind, should feel obvious. Not because it's unexamined, but because it holds up under examination. It's not about arbitrary rules. It’s about aligning individual behavior with collective well-being. It’s about reducing harm and increasing trust. It’s about virtue, not virtue signaling.

To recap: morality can be split into three broad categories.

Control-based morality, where rules exist to reinforce power hierarchies and restrict freedom.

Cohesion-based morality, where norms help bind a society through shared habits, rituals, and taboos, even if arbitrary.

Care-based morality, where values are grounded in preventing harm and enabling flourishing.

All three types coexist in any society. But not all deserve the same weight.

- The first kind, we should interrogate, challenge, and dismantle where necessary.
- The second kind, we can enjoy and adapt, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.
- The third kind, we must uphold and defend.

The morality we need is the one that helps us live together more honestly, more kindly, more equitably. The kind that doesn’t make doing the right thing harder but easier. The kind that discourages behaviors that fracture trust and rewards those that build stronger communities. The kind that doesn’t care how long your hair is but cares if you're lying to someone's face.

Morality, when built on care and virtue, doesn’t restrict freedom. It makes freedom possible.

## excerpt 2 - with religion

For a long time, morality was a dirty word to me. It didn’t mean kindness, honesty, or fairness. It meant control. It meant being told how long your hair could be, what words you were allowed to say, who you could love, and which god you could believe in—if any. Morality wasn’t about helping people. It was about restricting them. And that’s where many people’s discomfort with the word begins.

A big part of this discomfort comes from religious morality. Not religion itself, but the way religion has historically been used as the foundation of moral codes. These codes often come with absolute rules: do this, never do that. Some of them clearly serve social cohesion—don't steal, don't kill. But many others seem less about care and more about conformity. What you wear. Who you sleep with. Whether you kneel or stand. These are not universal principles of harm and fairness. They're boundary markers, tribal signals, tools of inclusion and exclusion.

Religious morality, when weaponized, doesn’t just guide behavior. It enforces obedience. And often, it protects hierarchies of power under the guise of virtue. The danger is that it can turn morality into something unchallengeable. If a rule is said to come from God, questioning it becomes heresy, not dialogue. This shuts down moral growth. It makes culture brittle. And brittle things break.

Yet I would like to emhapises that religion **isn't** inherently the problem. Some of the most profound moral thinking comes from religious traditions—compassion in Buddhism, justice in Islam, love in Christianity, duty in Hinduism. These are values worth holding onto. But it’s crucial to separate the spirit of those values from the scaffolding of institutional control. Morality must be allowed to evolve, to be discussed, to be tested against the real-world impact on real people. A religious hegemony rarely does good to society.

Now, let’s return to the broader idea of morality and try to divide it into clearer categories.

Let’s start with taboos. When looking at another culture, taboos often seem like arbitrary rules. But in our own, they don’t feel like rules at all. They feel like reality. Take public nudity. Some nipples are legal, others illegal. Everyone knows which are allowed and which aren’t, even if the distinction makes no objective sense. That’s the power of a taboo.
